# Fedora RPM Package For transgui Application

`transgui` is a feature rich cross platform Transmission BitTorrent
client. Faster and has more functionality than the built-in web GUI.
See its [home page](https://github.com/transmission-remote-gui/transgui)
for details.

This repository contains a `transgui.spec` file that helps me build
an installation RPM file for `transgui` for my Fedora desktop.  In 
addition, I posted the RPMs that I built in the
[Releases tab](https://github.com/dlk3/transgui-spec/releases) of this
repository
